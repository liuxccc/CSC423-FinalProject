#Our purpose is to determine a relationship between existing data measured by human resources departments and an employeeâ€™s intent to #leave a company. With the collected data set we aim to create a statistical model to help a company predict whether or not an employee #will leave a company, allowing the company to take action in order to increase employee retention and reduce employee attrition. 

#Using data from https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics-1
#Using SAS as our main tool.
